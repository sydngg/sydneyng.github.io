### About

I am currently a second-year MPH student studying Biostatistics and Epidemiology at The Mailman School of Public Health. I graduated from SUNY Geneseo in May 2019 with a BS in Applied Mathematics and minors in Biology and Communication.

This website was created for Data Science 1 with Jeff Goldsmith, PhD (Fall 2020).
