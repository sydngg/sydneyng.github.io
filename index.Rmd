### About me

I am a second-year MPH student studying Biostatistics and Epidemiology at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health. I graduated from The State University of New York at Geneseo in May 2019 with a BS in Applied Mathematics and minors in Biology and Communication.

Currently, I am working as a Graduate TA for Research Methods and Applications: Quantitative Research Methods and working under Wan Yang, PhD with a projected practicum research project and thesis on COVID-19 transmission in children. My general research interests are in infectious disease modeling, and maternal and child health.
