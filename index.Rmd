### About me

I am currently an Analyst at [Analysis Group](https://www.analysisgroup.com), located in Menlo Park, CA. 

I recently graduated in April 2021 with my MPH studying Biostatistics and Epidemiology at Columbia University, [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu). For undergrad, I graduated from [The State University of New York at Geneseo](https://www.geneseo.edu) in May 2019 with a BS in Applied Mathematics and minors in Biology and Communication.

For my practicum experience, I worked with Connor Reynolds under the supervision of Wan Yang, PhD from the Department of Epidemiology studying [factors affecting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in children in school settings](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.18.21259156). My general interests are in HEOR, infectious disease modeling, and maternal and child health, and I would love to use my strong quantitative and interpersonal skills to influence public policy one day.

I am excited to be in the workforce and apply all the knowledge I have gained in my graduate studies in the field of economic consulting, particularly in healthcare settings. When I am not working or studying, I love to stay busy by cooking, reading, weight training, and going to brunch on the weekends with friends!
